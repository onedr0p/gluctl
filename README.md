# gluctl

**The glue that helps maintain a Kubernetes Home Lab**

## Extending

Simply run `npm install` to install dependencies, then add new class and/or function files in [lib](./lib/) and add an export entry in [lib/index.js](lib/index.js). This will eventually be more dynamic in near future. `gluctl` serves as the main entrypoint to everything. There it runs the `commandRunner` helper function which accepts a command and any number of args.

Exports format in index.js should follow this format to work:

```javascript
export { SnakeCase as lowercase } from './ClassName.mjs'
```
